/// Factories are at a low level point of abstraction, as such, they are the "only" (best effort) objects that depend on
/// concrete class implementations instead of interfaces, intrinsically giving them tight coupling to the objects being
/// created. Keeping this coupling in a single file, is the best, as the rest of the code can be kept decoupled.
